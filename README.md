# moncard-lookup
A basic Python script that searches up Pokemon Cards.

## How to Run

To run, clone this repository into any directory.

Then, type this command into your terminal:

> python main.py

or, if you give it execution priveleges:

## Purpouse

There really isn't much purpouse to this. You could easily go to an online website and search up prices.

However, if you would like a decent CLI, use this! If you're using this for tinkering purpouses, thanks, and please contribute!
